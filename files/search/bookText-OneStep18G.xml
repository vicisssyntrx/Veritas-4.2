       the  crime  scene  accurately.  He  also  highlighted  the  role  of  crime
       scene  photographs,  fingerprint  analysis,  and  DNA  profiling  in
       supporting  the  prosecutor’s  case  in  court.  Students  were  introduced
       to  the  challenges  of  crime  scene  contamination  and  the  preventive
       measures  investigators  should  take.  Shri.  Yashwanth  Kumar
       concluded  with  a  reminder  that  proper  documentation  at  the  crime
       scene forms the backbone of the criminal justice process.

       The session highlighted key autopsy elements such as cause of death,
       time  of  death,  and  injury  analysis,  which  are  critical  in  criminal
       investigations.  Dr.  Dileepkumar  provided  examples  from  his  own
       experience  where  autopsy  reports  played  a  pivotal  role  in  securing
       convictions. He also discussed the challenges of conducting autopsies
       in  cases  of  decomposed  bodies  or  those  with  complex  trauma.  The
       importance  of  maintaining  accuracy  and  objectivity  in  autopsy
       findings  was  stressed,  as  these  reports  often  come  under  scrutiny
       during  cross-examinations.  He  shared  real-life  case  scenarios  where
       autopsy         reports        helped       solve       complex         cases,       especially         in
       determining  the  manner  of  death  (homicide,  suicide,  or  accident).
       The  session  concluded  with  a  discussion  on  the  evolving  techniques
       in     forensic        pathology,          which        are     aiding        in     more       precise

            Black  Dahlia  murder  (1947),  where

            nearly  500  people  confessed  to  the
            crime,  of  which  many  weren't  even

            born in that period.

         escaping the torture. This is the most widely                 1.Police interrogation:

         occurring form of false confession. E.g.: The                 "Coercion  Error"  is  a  leading

         3.Coerced-internalized false confession:                      break down an innocent person.

         This  type  of  confession  arises  from  extreme             Another       tactic    might      be
         psychological       manipulation        where       an        "Contamination  Error,"  which

         rape and murder of his 12-year-old daughter                   2.Biased investigation:
